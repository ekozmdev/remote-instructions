# Initialize Python Projects with uv

## Select the right reference
- Use `references/uv-guide.md` to pick the correct uv document quickly.

## Initialize a new project
- Follow `references/initialize-project.md` for the overall flow.
- Use `references/uv-init.md` for `uv init` options and the initial `pyproject.toml` setting.

## Verify uv or install on Windows
- Use `references/python-setup.md` to verify uv is available.
- If on Windows and uv is missing, use `references/uv-install-windows.md`.

## Add initial dependencies
- Use `references/uv-manage-dependencies.md`.
